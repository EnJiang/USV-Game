# USV-Game
A simple USV game model.<br>Comments are in Chinese, however I did try to make the code self-explanatory, help yourself.

##dependencies
1. Python2, sadly I don't intent to write code that fit both py2 and py3, so there might be problems running this project in Python3 envs.
2. pygame. To construct the display window, not necessary if no Game class that has a GUI window is called.
